# fractol
## This project is to create a small fractal exploration program. Start by seeing what a fractal is. 
## The constraints are as follows: 
```
* Your software should offer at least 3 different types of fractals, from which at least the Julia set 
  and the Mandelbrot set (a third fractal is your choice). 
* It must be possible to vary the mouse (without clicking) the parameter of the Julia set. 
  The other types of fractal, it is left to your option. 
* The mouse wheel zooms in and out on the current mouse position, and this in a quasi infinite way 
  (modulo the limits of the machine). This is the same principle of fractals.
* There must be a minimum play of color to feel the depth of each fractal. Better hack away on psychedelic effects. 
* A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal is to view. If there is no parameter provided, 
  or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays a list of available parameters and exits. 
  As regards the graphic representation: • You must use the minilibX, in its version for XQuartz installed by default on 
  the dump, or in its native version for MacOS X. • You have to manage properly the expose. • ESC will exit the program. 
* The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.
```
